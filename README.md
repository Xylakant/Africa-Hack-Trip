Originally inspired by the article "[From Kenya to Madagascar: The African tech-hub boom](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18878585)" I decided to organize a trip through [Africa's Hacker Spaces](https://africahubs.crowdmap.com/). Due 2013.

And I want to invite others to join, for the whole trip or for a shorter visit.

Interested? Thoughts? Ideas?
